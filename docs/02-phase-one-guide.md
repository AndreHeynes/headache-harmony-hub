# Phase 1 Guide: Understanding Where You Are Starting From

## Introduction to Phase 1

Welcome to Phase 1 of your personalized headache management program. This initial phase is crucial as it helps us understand your unique situation and establish a baseline for your treatment journey.

## What to Expect in Phase 1

Phase 1 lasts for 7 days and focuses on gathering information about your headache patterns, triggers, and impact on your daily life. During this week, you'll:

- Complete initial assessment questionnaires
- Track your daily symptoms and potential triggers
- Begin to identify patterns in your headache occurrences
- Establish a baseline for measuring your progress

## Completing the Questionnaires

You'll be asked to complete two important questionnaires during Phase 1:

1. **HIT-6 Questionnaire:** The Headache Impact Test measures how headaches affect your daily functioning and quality of life. This will help us understand the severity and impact of your condition.

2. **Headache Type Survey:** This questionnaire helps identify your specific type of headache, which is essential for targeting the right treatment approaches.

These questionnaires are designed to be completed in sections, and you can save your progress at any time. There are no right or wrong answers—the most important thing is to respond honestly based on your experience.

## Daily Tracking

Consistent tracking during Phase 1 is essential. We recommend:

- Recording headache episodes as they occur
- Noting potential triggers (food, stress, sleep patterns, etc.)
- Tracking the effectiveness of any relief measures you try
- Documenting the impact on your daily activities

You can use the tracking tools in this application or connect external tracking apps if you prefer. The key is consistency—even on days when you don't have headaches, logging this information is valuable.

## Preparing for Phase 2

By the end of Phase 1, we'll have gathered enough information to:

- Establish your headache profile and impact score
- Identify potential triggers and patterns
- Create a personalized plan for Phase 2

The data collected during Phase 1 will directly inform your personalized treatment approach in Phase 2, where we'll begin introducing specific therapeutic interventions based on your unique needs.

If you have any questions during Phase 1, please don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider through the support section of this application.
