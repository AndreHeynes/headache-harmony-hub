# Program Visualization & Journey Maps

## Complete Program Flow

The complete program flow showing progression from entry through all four phases to independent headache management.

- **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Baseline assessment with HIT-6 and headache type identification
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 2-11):** Active management including exercises, education, and lifestyle modifications
- **Phase 3 (Week 12, Days 1-7):** Progress evaluation with complete assessment battery
- **Phase 4 (Week 12, Day 8+):** Personalized maintenance program creation

## Patient Journey Map

### Week 1: Discovery
Complete assessment, understand headache profile, begin tracking

### Weeks 2-4: Learning
Learn exercises, understand pain science, identify triggers

### Weeks 5-8: Building Skills
