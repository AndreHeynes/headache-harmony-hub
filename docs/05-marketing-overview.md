### "I've tried everything already."
Unlike quick-fix solutions, this is a comprehensive program that addresses the multiple factors contributing to headaches. The research shows multimodal approaches work when single interventions don't.

### "I don't have time for this."
20-30 minutes a day is less time than most people spend dealing with the aftermath of headaches. Plus, it's self-paced—do activities when it fits your schedule.

### "Will this work for my type of headache?"
The program is designed for tension-type, cervicogenic, and migraine headaches. The initial assessment helps tailor the approach to your specific headache profile.

### "I'm not good with technology."
The program is designed to be user-friendly with clear instructions, video demonstrations, and simple tracking tools. No technical expertise required.

### "What if I need more help?"
While this is a self-guided program, it complements (doesn't replace) medical care. You can continue working with your healthcare provider while using the program.
